## What were the inputs you gave the simulation?

    Starting Inputs for the simulation are:
    
    Virus Data:
    + Virus Name (You can input any name)
    + Reproduction Rate (Percentage of people getting exposed)
    + Mortality Rate (Percentage of infected people dying from virus)
    
    Population Data:
    + Population Size (How many people)
    + Vaccination Rate (How many are already vaccinated)
    + Initial Infected (How many people start infected)

1. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

    If we use the Zombie Outbreak, around half of the population was infected before it started to burn out. At that time, just over 83% of the population alive was vaccinated. After that, infections and deaths dropped sharply until the end of the simulation.

2. What percentage of the population died from the virus?

    In this simulation, we had a reproduction rate of 30% and mortality rate of 40%. Around 32% of the population died and the numbers can fluctuate with small changes to the reproduction or mortality rate. Each run of the simulation also produced similar but slightly different results.

3. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

    Out of around 8,000,000 interactions the vaccine saved people in interactions just under 4,400,000 times.
